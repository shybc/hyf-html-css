        <p class="info-paragraph-text">Mantises are an order <em>(Mantodea)</em> of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest family is the Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They
          have <strong>triangular heads with bulging eyes</strong> supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but <strong>all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey</strong>;
          their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name <u>praying mantis</u>.<br><br> The closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder
          <em>Dictyoptera</em>. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae).<br>

      <div class="info-paragraph">
        <p class="info-paragraph-text">Mantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have <strong>two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae</strong>. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species
          of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180Â°. The mantis thorax consists of a <em>prothorax</em>, a <em>mesothorax</em>, and a <em>metathorax</em>. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs,
          is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.<br><br> Mantises
          have <strong>two spiked, grasping forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely</strong>. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous
          base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration).<br>

          <!-- Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium. -->

        <p class="info-paragraph-text">Mantises have <strong>stereo vision</strong>. They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain <u>up to 10,000 ommatidia</u>. A small area at the front called <em>the fovea</em> has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and
          can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; <strong>when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea</strong>.
          Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea. The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic
          vision at close range. The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a <em>pseudopupil</em>. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed "head-on" absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.<br><br>          As their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family Liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately
          males; this is probably true for most mantises.<br>
